# Final-Project
Code Louisville Final Project by John Salyer
I created a web page with the idea of sending a positive message with a calming effect. I wanted to let people know that they are important.
This is my first coding project.
-I have included a nav menu with javascript
-I have also included accordion boxes with css and javascript
