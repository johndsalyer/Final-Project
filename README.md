# Final-Project
Code Louisville Final Project by John Salyer
I created a web page with the idea of sending a positive message with a calming effect. I wanted to let people know that they are important.
This is my first coding project. I used 2 media inquires to change the page layout for a more mobile friendly experience.

-I have included a nav menu with javascript

-I have also included accordion boxes with css and javascript

-I have ran a PageSpeed Insights test with the results being: Performance 100, Accessibility 81, Best Practices 92, and SEO 75
